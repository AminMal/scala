t11921-alias.scala:16: error: reference to TT is ambiguous;
it is both defined in object O and available as type TT in class C
Since 2.13.11, symbols inherited from a superclass no longer shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
If shadowing was intended, write `this.TT`.
Or use `-Ylegacy-binding` to enable the previous behavior everywhere.
