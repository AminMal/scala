t12071.scala:15: error: postfix operator i needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.postfixOps visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.postfixOps'
or by setting the compiler option -language:postfixOps.
See the Scaladoc for value scala.language.postfixOps for a discussion
why the feature needs to be explicitly enabled.
Lines starting with an operator are taken as an infix expression continued from the previous line in Scala 3 (or with -Xsource-features:leading-infix).
To force the current interpretation as a separate statement, add an explicit `;`, add an empty line, or remove spaces after the operator.
