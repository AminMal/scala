Test1.scala:4: warning: This wildcard import imports a.O, which is shadowed by b.O.
This is not according to the language specification and has changed in Scala 2.13, where a.O takes precedence.
To keep the same meaning in 2.12 and 2.13, un-import O by adding `O => _` to the import list.
import a._
